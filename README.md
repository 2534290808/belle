Belle Documentation
================

## Setup

```
npm install
```

Note: To make the development setup as easy as possible `npm install` will copy
the code styles from node_modules & establish a symlink from inside node_modules
to the root of the belle directory. Ideally `npm link` could be used, but it
doesn't play well with `peerDependencies` -> [Issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5875).

## Development Environment

```
npm start
```
